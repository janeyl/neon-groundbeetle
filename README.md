Data and code for "Evergreen gymnosperm tree abundance drives ground beetle density and community composition in eastern US temperate forests"

The beetle and vegetation data from NEON sites is stored in "NEONdata.RData". 
Supplemental plant fungal associations is in "plantSpecies.csv" and a table containing ground beetle functional groups in "Ordination/function-table-dec.csv"

The main analysis was done in "v2JLienau_RCode_GB.R" script file. This script contains the code to create the following csv files 
allHARV.csv
allTALL.csv
BART_data.csv
expertTax_HARV.csv
expertTax_TALL.csv
HARV_data.csv
JERC_data.csv
sppTable.csv
table.csv
TALL_data.csv
vegB.csv

The foler "Functional-Ecology" contains the code and data for our analysis and figures on functional groups of ground beetles

the folder "Ordination" contains the code and data for an ordination and permanova analysis.

The statistical table was built in "stats-table.R" script file.
